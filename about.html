            <p>Global Excellence Foundation (GEF) is dedicated to identifying, supporting, and nurturing exceptional young talent across the globe. We believe in creating opportunities for extraordinary individuals to reach their full potential and make meaningful contributions to society.</p>

            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2015 by a coalition of educators, industry leaders, and philanthropists, GEF began with a simple premise: extraordinary talent exists in every corner of the world, but opportunity does not.</p>
            <p>What started as a scholarship program supporting 10 exceptional students has grown into a comprehensive global initiative with multiple programs spanning academic excellence, entrepreneurship, leadership development, and social impact projects.</p>
            <p>Today, our network includes over 500 scholars across 45 countries, with alumni who have gone on to found successful companies, lead groundbreaking research, and create positive change in their communities.</p>
